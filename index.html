            <img src="images/saopaulo.jpeg" alt="São Paulo landscape">
            <p>São Paulo (Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil
            and serves as the capital of the state of São Paulo. Recognized by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo holds the
            title of the most populous city in the world outside of Asia and ranks as the 20th-largest city proper globally by
            population. It is also the largest Portuguese-speaking city worldwide. The city exerts significant international
            influence in commerce, finance, arts, and entertainment. Named in honor of the Apostle Saint Paul of Tarsus, São Paulo's
            metropolitan area, known as Greater São Paulo, is the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous globally. The
            conurbation process between the metropolitan areas surrounding Greater São Paulo, including Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí,
            Sorocaba, and São José dos Campos, has led to the formation of the São Paulo Macrometropolis. This megalopolis boasts
            over 30 million inhabitants, making it one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.</p>
